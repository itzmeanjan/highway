Cross Blockchain Message Passing Framework

## Motivation

We're living in a time when new blockchain(s) popping up every single day & we've our assets distributed across all those self-sovereign chains, each using similar/ different mechanism for reaching consensus.

This project is an attempt in creating a generic framework for passing arbitrary messages in between applications running on two different chains. These applications are distributed in nature, but their state is not necessarily shared across multiple chains. This project will attempt to standardise some interfaces so that dApps running on different chains can talk to their peers.

In future date contributors can add support for more chains, following specification defined below, for reliably passing ordered, authenticated messages between a pair of chains. This enables users of this framework to distribute their application state on two different chains & build some interesting projects.

> One thing I'd like to clear, this project doesn't think any chain as **root chain ( i.e. L1 ) / child chain ( i.e. L2 )**, rather every participating chain is considered to be operating independently.

---

We need two components for reliably passing messages between two applications running on two different chains.

- OnChain Entity
- OffChain Entity

Let's expand on each of these.

### OnChain Entity

Let's say application **A1**, **A2** running on chain **C1**, **C2** respectively, wants to talk to each other, below is a proposed flow.

---

**A1** invokes `send(uint chainId, address app, byte[] message)` method of `Highway` dApp deployed on **C1**, as an effect of user triggered tx **T1**, which will result into emission of event log of below form

```js
Message(uint sourceChainId, address sourceApp, uint targetChainId, address targetApp, uint nonce, bytes[] message)
```

We asume, in block **B1** of chain **C1**, tx **T1** is included. How this event log will be captured by **OFFCHAIN** entity, we'll see that in sometime.

For emitting event of aforementioned form, we need to hold some state in `Highway` on **C1**.

> Think of `Highway` on **C1** as a gateway to send message to outer world, where some outer world entity will pick it up & send _( not always )_ it to recipient chain's `Highway`, which will eventually send it to `targetApp` i.e. **A2** on **C2**.

For each dApp, on any possible chain _( != **C1** )_, to which any application on **C1** might ever want to send message, we're keeping some state using following data structure

```js
var state = allocate(map[address]map[uint]map[address]uint) // allocates memory for top level associative array
```

> `allocate(...)` only allocates space for top level associative array, if it's a nested structure.

Ok, let's split this data structure into it's components & see what each level serves.

**Flow :**

When **A1** invoked `Highway.send(uint chainId, address app, byte[] message)`, we start by finding out if **A1** has ever attempted to send any message to outer world or not. This can be done by doing a O(1) look up

```js
var _, ok = state[A1]
if ok {
    // yes it tried
} else {
    // no, first attempt
}
```

If **NO**, we're creating an entry of following kind

```js
state[A1] = allocate(map[uint]map[address]uint)
state[A1][chainId] = allocate(map[address]uint)

var nonce = state[A1][chainId][app] // default value 0
state[A1][chainId][app]++
```

If **YES**, we'll look up if **A1** ever tried to send message to `chainId` or not, which can be done by looking up

```js
var _, ok = state[A1][chainId]
if ok {
    // yes, it did
} else {
    // no, it didn't, first attempt to `chainId`
}
```

If **NO**, we'll create an entry for `chainId`

```js
state[A1][chainId] = allocate(map[address]uint)

var nonce = state[A1][chainId][app]
state[A1][chainId][app]++
```

If **YES**, we'll lookup respective nonce

```js
var nonce = state[A1][chainId][app]
state[A1][chainId][app]++
```

So we're finally figured out `nonce` to be used for emitting event

```js
var sourceChainId = getChainId() // C1's built-in function
var sourceApp = getSenderAddress() // C1's built-in function
var targetChainId = chainId
var targetApp = app
var nonce = ... // we just figured it out

emit Message(sourceChainId, sourceApp, targetChainId, targetApp, nonce, message) // voila üéâ
```

---

‚ÑπÔ∏è We've one imaginary **OFFCHAIN** entity for picking events emitted from `Highway` running on **C1** & reliably passing it to `Highway` running on **C2**. How exactly these **OFFCHAIN** entities work, is a blackbox to us, as of now. We'll work on their specification, once we're done with **ONCHAIN** entities.

---

Let's now step-by-step go through what happens, when `Highway` on **C2** receives message sent by **A1** of **C1**, in form

```js
receive(uint sourceChainId, address sourceApp, uint targetChainId, address targetApp, uint nonce, byte[] message)
```

It's obvious that receiving side also should keep some state for checking orderliness of messages received from sender.

Proposed data structure looks like

```js
var state = allocate(map[address]map[uint]map[address]uint)
```

First we start by checking whether this message is for this chain or not

```js
var chainId = getChainId() // C2's built-in function
if chainId != targetChainId {
    // not for us
    return
}
// proceed
```

We can now try to see if this is first time **A2** is receiving message from outside world or not, which can be done via this look up

```js
var _, ok = state[A2]
if ok {
    // not first time
} else {
    // it's first time
}
```

If **YES**, we need to create some entries, before performing orderliness check

```js
state[A2] = allocate(map[uint]map[address]uint)
state[A2][sourceChainId] = allocate(map[address]uint)

var expectedNonce = state[A2][sourceChainId][sourceApp] // default value 0
if expectedNonce != nonce {
    // ordering not being respected
    return
}
// we go to next step
```

If **NO**, we'll try to find if it's first time **A2** receiving message from `sourceChainId`, which can be done by

```js
var _, ok = state[A2][sourceChainId]
if ok {
    // not first time
} else {
    // yes it's
}
```


If **YES**, we create an entry for future usage, after that we'll do our usual orderliness check

```js
state[A2][sourceChainId] = allocate(map[address]uint)

var expectedNonce = state[A2][sourceChainId][sourceApp]
if expectedNonce != nonce {
    // ordering not being respected
    return
}
// we go to next step
```

If **NO**, we directly lookup expected nonce for this combination

```js
var expectedNonce = state[A2][sourceChainId][sourceApp]
if expectedNonce != nonce {
    // ordering not being respected
    return
}

// incrementing expected nonce, for next message
state[A2][sourceChainId][sourceApp]++
```

If orderliness is checked to be passing, `Highway` will invoke `targetApp.onReceive(uint chainId, address app, uint nonce, byte[] message)`, which will finally handle incoming message. Successful execution of message consumption tx, must emit event

```js
emit MessageReceived(uint sourceChainId, address sourceApp, uint targetChainId, address targetApp, uint nonce, bytes[] message)
```
